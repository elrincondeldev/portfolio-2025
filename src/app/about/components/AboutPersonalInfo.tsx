        Before becoming a developer, I worked in various roles, including
        cashier, operator, and telemarketer. The turning point came when I was
        buying a phone on Apple&apos;s websiteâ€”I was fascinated by the seamless user
        experience it provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of creating something that impactful felt incredible. From that
        moment on, I started paying attention to the small details of the
        websites I visited regularly, sparking my curiosity about web
        development. Determined to learn, I began studying entirely on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly realized how much I enjoyed it, so I never considered pursuing
        a formal degree. Just a few months after starting, I landed my first job
        as a developer.

      <p>Today, I have over two years of experience in web development.</p>
